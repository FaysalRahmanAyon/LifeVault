# LifeVault
LifeVault is a "dead man's switch" solution for your digital life. It allows you to aggregate critical digital assets (bank accounts, crypto wallets, legal documents), encrypt them client-side into a portable .vault file, and provide a secure, offline Python mechanism for your beneficiaries to recover them.
